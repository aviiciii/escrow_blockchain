## Introduction

The blockchain escrow project provides a decentralized escrow service using smart contracts on the blockchain. It ensures the secure transfer of funds by acting as a trusted intermediary between buyers and sellers. The escrow service holds the funds until the specified conditions, defined in the smart contract, are met, providing assurance and protection for both parties involved in a transaction.

## Installation and Setup

To run the blockchain escrow service, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) or any other Ethereum development environment of your choice.
2. Create a new workspace.
3. Copy the contents of `escrow.sol` from this repository and paste it into the Remix workspace under the "contracts" section.
4. Compile the smart contract by pressing Ctrl+S or using the appropriate compilation option in your Ethereum development environment.
5. Deploy the smart contract by providing an escrow fee and a shipper account. This step will vary depending on the Ethereum development environment you are using. Follow the deployment instructions provided by the environment.
6. Once the smart contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the available functions. You can add items, buy them, and deliver them based on the functionality provided by the smart contract.

## Usage

To use the blockchain escrow service, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the smart contract is deployed and running.
2. Use the provided functions in the smart contract to perform escrow transactions.
3. Follow the specific instructions and conditions defined in the smart contract for each transaction type (e.g., adding items, buying items, delivering items).
4. Monitor the status of escrow transactions to ensure the proper flow and completion of each transaction.
